# VolleyDeepQLearning

Final project for ECS 518 and EK 505 @ Boston University. My team and I developed the theoretical autonomy stack for an autonomous ping pong ball picker robot. I was responsible for the deep reinforcement learning portion as well as general machine learning and software guidance for my team. This included CNN training with YOLOv8 and MobileNetV3, LiDAR simulation, and AprilTag detection.


See the ECS 518 report for more in-depth theory and analysis on the reinforcement learning and the EK 505 report for the comprehensive report of all components.
