# VolleyDeepQLearning

Final project for ECS 518 and EK505 @ Boston University. My team and I developed the theoretical autonomy stack for an autonomous ping pong ball picker robot. I was responsible for the deep reinforcement learning portion as well as general machine learning and software guidance for my team. This included CNN training with YOLOv7 and MobileNetV3, LiDAR simulation, and AprilTag detection.
